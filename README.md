# House-Price-Prediction-using-Neural-Network

House price prediction using artificial neural network involves training a network on a dataset of labeled information about houses such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The network will learn to identify patterns and features that are indicative of the prices of different houses. The input layer of the network takes in the house data, while the hidden layers perform calculations and identify patterns. The output layer produces a predicted price for each house. The accuracy of the prediction model can be improved by optimizing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, and learning rate. The performance of the network can also be enhanced by using pre-processing techniques such as feature scaling and normalization. In summary, artificial neural networks can be an effective tool for house price prediction when trained and optimized correctly.
